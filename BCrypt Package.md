# Package Library Overview

## Package/Library Selected: 
BCrypt
## Package/Library Description:
   ### Purpose:
The purpose of the bcrypt library in JavaScript (specifically in Node.js environments) 
is to securely hash passwords or other sensitive data. Hashing is a cryptographic 
technique that transforms input data (such as a password) into a fixed-size string of 
characters, called a hash value or hash digest. The primary purposes of using bcrypt 
for hashing passwords are security and privacy protection: [https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/]
   ### Usage:  
   To use the BCrypt package, you first need to install it using `npm install 
   bcrypt`.After installation, you need the `require (bcrypt)` at the beginning of your program
   The hash function requires 3 parameters 
   1. Plain text password to be hashed
   2. Number of saltrounds (increases security by generating random strings to help complicate 
      the hashed password
   3.An error catch.[https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/]

 ### Functionalities:
   #### Secure Passwords
   Storing passwords in plain text is extremely insecure because if a database containing plain 
   text passwords is compromised, attackers can easily use the passwords to gain unauthorized access 
   to user accounts. Bcrypt helps reduce this risk by securely hashing passwords before storing 
   them in a database. The hashed passwords are not reversible, meaning that even if an attacker 
   obtains the hash values, they cannot easily reverse-engineer the original passwords.[https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/]

   #### Compare 
   The bcrypt.compare() function takes the plain text password and the hashed password as input.
   It applies the same hashing algorithm and salt that were used to hash the original password.
   The function then compares the hashed version of the plain text password with the provided hashed password.
   If the two passwords match, the result parameter in the callback function will be true.
   If the passwords do not match, the result parameter will be false.[https://dev.to/documatic/what-is-bcrypt-how-to-use-it-to-hash-passwords-5c0g]
   

### Creation Date: 
  The BCrypt hash function package was created June 1997 [https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt]
### Reason for Selection: 
  One of the primary reasons for choosing bcrypt is its strong security features. Bcrypt is specifically 
  designed for password hashing and incorporates features like salting and adaptive hashing, which enhance 
  password security. Passwords are stored securely, even if the database is compromised. I also chose BCrypt
  for the oppertunity to learn about password hashing, salting, and protection against common attacks like 
  brute force and rainbow table attacks. This exploration activity increased my understanding of security 
  practices used in password protection.
### Impact on Learning: 
BCrypt
  Allowed for the oppertunity to learn about password hashing, salting, and protection against common attacks like 
  brute force and rainbow table attacks. This exploration activity increased my understanding of security 
  practices used in password protection.
### Overall Experience:
  My experience with the BCypt package was positive overall. It gave me a better understanding of how hashing 
  works, and the complicated challenges faced for cyber security. I was shocked that it was developed in 1997,
  I was expecting much later
